### What is a Boilerplate?

<cite>In information technology, a boilerplate is a unit of writing that can be reused over and over without change. By extension, the idea is sometimes applied to reusable programming as in "boilerplate code." The term derives from steel manufacturing, where boilerplate is steel rolled into large plates for use in steam boilers. The implication is either that boilerplate writing has been time-tested and strong as "steel," or possibly that it has been rolled out into something strong enough for repeated reuse. Legal agreements, including software and hardware terms and conditions, make abundant use of boilerplates. The term is also used as an adjective as in "a boilerplate paragraph" and also as in "The entire document was boilerplate."</cite>
